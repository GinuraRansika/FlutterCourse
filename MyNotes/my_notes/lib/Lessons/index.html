 <!-- 
        ! To make the app faster
            * Cut the material app and paste it inside the runApp() int the void main()
            * then delete the MyApp class
  -->

  <!-- 
        ! Stateless and Stateful
            * stateful - widgets can keep the information and upon who's changing it can redraw itself
                         * widget that contains information that can be changed as the user interacts with the widget or with the time

            * stateless - widgets that cannot contain mutable variables or information
