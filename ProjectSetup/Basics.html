    ! Project Setup

    ? Set project up from Terminal
        * Using "flutter create --org xxx.domain appname" (reverse identity - ginura.lk)
            * flutter create --org lk.ginura exampleApp
        
    ? Adding Dependencies
        * to work with firebase we need 4 dependencies 
            * flutter pub add firebase_core
            * flutter pub add firebase_auth
            * flutter pub add cloud_firestore
            * flutter pub add firebase_analytics

        ? firebase_core - what we are going to use as our server where all the nodes for all all our users are going to sit
        ? firebase_auth - for authentication (where users will be able to register, log into our app, log out and also get email confirmation)
        ? cloud_firestore - when we store logged in users notes in the firebase backend
        ? firebase_analytics - you will get free analytics when you setup  your firebase backend (which screen did the user go to , which button did they press etc.)
